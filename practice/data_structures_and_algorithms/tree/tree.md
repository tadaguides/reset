# Trees

## [Binary Tree] Summary
* A tree is a data structure to simulate a hierarchical tree structure.
* Each node of the tree will have a root value and a list of references to other nodes which are called child nodes. 
* From graph view, a tree can also be defined as a directed acyclic graph which has N nodes and N-1 edges.
* A Binary Tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

## [Binary Tree] Key Concepts
* Understand the concept of a tree and a binary tree
* Be familiar with different traversal methods: understanding these traversal methods will provide a solid foundation for the further study.
  * Understand the difference between different tree traversal methods
  * Be able to solve preorder, inorder and postorder traversal recursively
  * Be able to solve preorder, inorder and postorder traversal iteratively
  * Be able to do level traversal using BFS
* Use recursion to solve binary-tree-related problems
