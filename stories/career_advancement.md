ON: Career Advancement

=> Tech Promotions (https://www.teamblind.com/article/Thank-you-Blind-JpZWEdHg)
* Get a visible project, document your contributions with quantitative metrics, make your managers and team’s life easier, be independent and proactive, identify problems nd fix them without being ‘assigned’ tasks, drive the charter of your project.
* And most importantly, find a manager who appreciates the above, has budget for promotions and be explicit and strongly demand your promotion after proving your worth
* You are responsible for your career, don't wait for someone else to pull you along when so many others hustle like the above. And please, don't complain all the time, it's draining (I should take my own advice...)
* You can do it but you need persistence and lots of interview practice if you want to get into Google or Facebook. To give you some unbelievable context I have solved 2500+ LC-style questions compared to others who solve some 200ish questions. It took a few years as I used to interview every year. I have my own way of revisiting every interesting idea I came across so my preparation is always cumulative.
