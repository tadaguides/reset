[REMINDERS]
"To me, the Mamba Mentality is a really simple one. The confidence comes from preparation. 
So, when the game's on the line, I'm not asking myself to do something I haven't done thousands of times before. 
Right? 
So, when I prepare, 
I know what I'm capable of doing, 
I know what I'm comfortable doing, and 
I know what I'm not comfortable doing. 
So in those moments, if it looks if I'm ice cold or not nervous, it's because I've done it thousands of times before. 
So, what's one more time?" 
- Kobe Bryant, Mamba Mentality Interview
