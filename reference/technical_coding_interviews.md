Fundamentals: I have a pretty good knowledge of fundamentals. If you don't, I 100% recommend you go through an algorithms book. Yes, I know, it's no fun if you haven't done a class on it before, but I believe is the best way to at least get a grasp of everything. I dislike interview preparation books (CTCI is just bad in my opinion), but I guess they're better than nothing. I suggest CLRS as a first algorithms book. You don't need to understand the math behind it, but at least be comfortable in how to design an algorithm.

Leetcode: I first did the "Top Interview Questions" collection (available for free), I did the medium collection fully and some of the problems from the hard collection. It's good because it exposes you to a lot of different areas (you need to be good at ALL of those).

Then I bought Leetcode Premium. This unlocks company tags (useless for some companies like Google, more useful for Microsoft and others). I spent 90% of my time doing the "mock interviews". Trust me, that was the thing that really made me excel in my interviews. The mock interviews give you a strict time limit, and in the end, they give you a percentage rating against all the other people that did the same mock interview set. This is much, much more useful than looking at the percentile for individual problems since many people just copy and paste the code from the top most-voted answer and get 100% percentile, making the average score go up. In a mock interview you don't have access to the discussion forum (of course, you can open another tab and cheat, but I feel like most people won't do that).

Be really comfortable with easy questions. This means <5 minutes each, at most. Binary search, sorting, simple data structure operations must be automatic. Medium questions are the most important ones to do in order to prepare for interviews. Don't spend too much time on hard questions: if you are comfortable with mediums, then usually hard questions are just a intricate mix of medium questions. If you can't get to a solution after 30 mins (or 1 hour if you feel like you're close), just look up the solution, and then go back and solve the question in your own code. Don't copy and paste!

Once you're comfortable solving questions, focus on speed. Mock interviews are good for that, because they give you a time limit and put you under pressure. My target times were:
Easy: < 5 minutes.
Medium: < 15 - 20 minutes.
Hard: < 30 - 40 minutes.

I achieved the desired target time for easy and medium questions, but hard questions can be really frustrating and never achieved a consistent < 40 minutes. Some hard questions I was never able to solve, and that's fine. Focus on medium.

My ratio was 20/70/10 easy/medium/hard. I had one month to prepare, I did around 200 leetcode I would say (unfortunately problems solved in mock interviews are not counted towards the total solved, so I'll never know how many I've actually solved).

Then, identify one area where you suck. In my case, dynamic programming. Read up tutorials / book chapters / explanations on that area, and understand the solution to common problems really well (like rod cutting for dynamic programming). Then go to the relative section on Leetcode and start doing them until you feel good. After doing like 15 dynamic programming questions I finally felt like I could get the hang of it.

In terms of tutorials: do not use random online resources! I can't stress this enough. There's so much crap online that you don't want to get inspiration from! GeeksForGeeks is a terrible resource, for example. Answers are often wrong, with bad English, terrible explanations, and the site has a horrible interface. Prefer blog posts from reputable sources (like actual interviewers), or books. Just search your problem on Google and choose wisely (look at multiple explanations!).

TL;DR: Leetcode mock interviews saved my life. Use real resources, not random online blogs. Focus on correctness, and then speed.

* Status: Software Engineer with 15 years of Professional Experience
* Position: Google L5
* Location: Mountain View, CA
* Date: October 14, 2019

Background:

Hi, my name is Clayton. First off I'd like to give a big thanks to the folks at leetcode (both problem setters and problem solvers), the questions and solutions posted on this site are helpful for understanding algorithms from multiple perspectives expressed via different thought processes and languages. I've paid for two 1-year leetcode subscriptions so far, and I strongly feel those were the two best investments I've made in years. I've been a professional software engineer since I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2004 from the University of Arizona. I honestly never really learned much about algorithms in my undergraduate studies. I simply learned enough about them to pass some tests. During my career, I slowly forgot whatever I did learn about algorithms. The majority of my professional work was performed in the wireless industry where I developed a highly proprietary skillset. When it was time for me to move on to the next chapter of my career, I had a very hard time with interviews. I was extremely uptight, nervous, and anxious about interviewing; and I failed 100% of the technical phone screens I attempted. I thought to myself, "What's wrong with me? Why am I receiving so many NOs?" Then I took a leetcode contest for the first time and answered none of the questions during that contest. This was a shock for me: as if this objective measurement of sub-optimal performance slapped me straight in the face. So I decided to start learning again, basically from scratch. This was an extremely slow and frustrating experience at first. I would regularly take 1 or 2 weeks to solve easy leetcode problems. However, I stuck with it and found help in the solutions posted in discussion boards associated with each problem.

==> Preparation:
* I started using leetcode to study algorithms and data structures about 2 years ago in 2017 after I totally bombed a handful of technical phone screens. I consistently set aside 30-60 minutes each day to solve leetcode problems.
* I also believe the following 3 online courses were extremely beneficial to help my mind "shift gears" to understand the fundamental basics of algorithms and data structures:

  * Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects
  * Tim Roughgarden's Algorithms Specialization
  * UCSD's Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization

==> Contests:
* On average I currently solve 1 or 2 questions during each Leetcode contest. You can check out my Leetcode profile here: https://leetcode.com/claytonjwong/. I'm definitely not the sharpest tool in the shed, but I am willing and able to learn (...and keep learning ...and never give up!).
* Only once did I answer all 4 questions correctly during contest 127
1005. Maximize Sum Of Array After K Negations
1006. Clumsy Factorial
1007. Minimum Domino Rotations For Equal Row
1008. Construct Binary Search Tree from Preorder Traversal
* I solved 2 questions during the most recent virtual contest 162. And I solved the 3rd question about 5 minutes after this virtual contest ended:
1252. Cells with Odd Values in a Matrix
1253. Reconstruct a 2-Row Binary Matrix
1254. Number of Closed Islands
* I've only solved a handful of "hard" questions. Each contest's 4th question is usually the "Hard" question, and I usually do not get to the 4th question before the contest ends. I hope it's reassuring and helpful to know that having the ability to consistently solve a couple easy/medium questions is considered "good enough". I suggest focusing on the fundamentals, not the outliers. I estimate solving 45% easy, 45% medium, and 10% hard. Honestly 10% is probably a high estimate for solving "hard" questions, but the point I'm trying to make is the majority of my time is currently consumed by solving easy and medium questions.

==> Phone Interviews: I had two technical phone interviews, each about 1 hour to answer 1 question. I believe I had a second technical phone interview because I barely "passed" the first technical phone interview.

* Round 1: The first phone interview question was solved by a greedy algorithm similiar to the following leetcode questions:
455. Assign Cookies
759. Employee Free Time
860. Lemonade Change
1103. Distribute Candies to People

* Round 2: The second phone interview question was solved by a linear scan and processing of input in a well-defined manner similiar to the following leetcode questions:
739. Daily Temperatures
1109. Corporate Flight Bookings
1186. Maximum Subarray Sum with One Deletion
1191. K-Concatenation Maximum Sum
1218. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence of Given Difference


==> Onsite Interviews: I had 4 technical interviews, 1 lunch break "interview", and 1 behavioral interview. The first 3 technical interview questions were similiar to the following 3 categories of Leetcode questions:

* Round 1: Parenthesis
20. Valid Parentheses
678. Valid Parenthesis String
856. Score of Parentheses
921. Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid
1021. Remove Outermost Parentheses
1190. Reverse Substrings Between Each Pair of Parentheses
1249. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses

* Round 2: Dynamic Programming
746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs
931. Minimum Falling Path Sum
935. Knight Dialer
1025. Divisor Game
1155. Number of Dice Rolls With Target Sum

* Round 3: Graph (BFS/DFS)
802. Find Eventual Safe States
818. Race Car
841. Keys and Rooms
842. Split Array into Fibonacci Sequence
1042. Flower Planting With No Adjacent
1129. Shortest Path with Alternating Colors
1136. Parallel Courses

* Round 4: The fourth interview focused on System Design. The problem was the unlike most leetcode questions where there exists a clearly optimal method or strategy to solve the problem (ie. all above examples have a "category" or "flavor" or "type" of problem). This System Design problem really threw me for a loop because I have perfectionist tendencies. The most similiar leetcode problem I could find would be 1247. Minimum Swaps to Make Strings Equal. I looked at this problem for an hour trying to calculate a simple and concise "formula". However, there is no "formula" that I could find. Instead this problem required some unique reasoning. For me, this fourth interview question was by far the hardest interview question since it required similar unique reasoning.

* Round 5: The lunch "interview" was awesome. All food at Google is free, so I chowed down on some amazingly tasty fish and learned more about Google during a casual lunch in the downstairs cafeteria.

* Round 6: The behavioral interview was performed in usual, industry expected manner.

Summary and Advice:

* Don't try to "fake" it. Either you actually know algorithms and data structures XOR you know about algorithms and data structures. This small difference is a huge difference! It is impossible to "fake" algorithmic thinking and understanding. Objective measurement of your individual performance can be derived from weekly leetcode.com contests.

* There are 3 stages to acquire a new skill:

1. Cognitive: focused thought required to perform a task
2. Associative: improved accuracy and efficiency, much less concentration required to perform a task
3. Autonomous: perform task automatically with barely any concious effort at all with optimal accuracy and efficiency

* In order to "pass" the onsite interview, I strongly feel that one needs to be at the autonomous stage for understanding and coding all basic algorithms and data structures. Google provides candidates more than enough preparation material to understand what "basic" means (ie. Trees, Graphs (BFS/DFS/DFS+BT), DP (top-down/bottom-up), Stacks/Queues, Hash Tables, etc.). I estimate studying 10-20% of the preparation material provided by Google a few weeks prior to interviews; it's significant amount of information to "digest" in a short period of time.

* A Rubik's cube can be used as a canonical physical example of autonomous algorithmic understanding. Check out this YouTube video of 2 solutions. An astute observer will notice that I definitely "messed up" a handful of times while solving both the Beginner's Method as well as the Fridrich Method. However, I do not beat myself up about it. We are all human beings, and none of us is perfect. So don't be too hard on yourself, especially when learning something new. Each time I made a mistake, I simply thought, "oops", and resumed the next steps towards a solution the best I could. Always focus on the process towards a solution, not the bumps in the road on your journey there. I'm currently at the autonomous stage for the Beginner's Method, and I'm somewhere between the cognitive/associative stages for the Fridrich Method F2L. I hope that helps provide a better "feel" for what each of those 3 stages mean. Note: A few months after I joined leetcode in 2017 and studied Stefan Pochmann's solutions, I stumbled upon the Old Pochmann Algorithm. And I told myself, "if this fellow can solve a Rubik's cube blindfolded, I can at least learn how to solve it with my eyes open!" (that's easier said than done, if anyone's interested in learning, check this out: https://claytonjwong.github.io/rubiks-cube/).

* Know when to use which data structure and algorithm: Most questions are open-ended and require additional information gathering. Clearly and concisely communicate your thought process while solving the problem. My perfectionist tendencies are to create an elegant solution on the first try. However, all questions asked onsite were non-trivial for which there exists no immediate "perfect" solution. Start off with a "good enough" working solution, then optimize it. There's no sense optimizing an incorrect solution! Start off with basic fundamentals, and incrementally refactor "as needed".

* Be a humble, life-long learner. Never give up! Never surrender!

* There's a lot of information to acquire for simply understanding the fundamentals of algorithms. For example, the CLRS "Intro to Algorithms" book is 1292 pages long; that's a loquacious "introduction"! It takes time to fundamentally understand these algorithms by sharpening the mind's eye. However, the brain can slowly restructure itself to meet cognitive demands. Just learn a little bit each day and stick with it. The compounding interest (ie. pay day) will come. That's the law of the harvest, you reap what you sow.
* Final Thoughts: I really hope this is a helpful and motivational post for everyone, and especially for "older" software engineers like myself. Have fun and keep learning! Continually re-invent yourself as a modern software engineer.


## How to get into FAANG
* Prompt: Suggest the best resources for each topic that Faang interviewer can ask. You may include a few books as well if really needed, but I honestly prefer online resources. Also, I will be happier if you give the one resource recommendations for one topic. If you have two recommendations for some of the topics and you feel that I should go through both, then suggest both.
* URL: https://www.rooftopslushie.com/request/How-to-get-into-FAANG---proper-plan-with-sources-241
* The resources you need are fairly straightforward. I’m going to make this one long post and copy paste the response because you essentially are asking a derivation of each question in each section of your post.
* Instead of simply answering your above post let me give you a rough timeline since you have no prior knowledge. Before Leetcode get 1 book. Go through MOST of Cracking the Coding Interview. I say most because there are sections (like the one on math) that are increasingly less important for CS interviews.
* Follow the entirety of the book taking copious notes and attempting EVERY problem (NO SHORTCUTS!). You can think of the book as essentially your version of taking college level DS and Algo courses. Once you complete the book and problems you will have benefitted twofold:
1. You will have practiced actual interview problems
2. You will have a good framework for your preparation
3. You will have 90% of the fundamentals down for all possible coding problems
4. You should have / will have identified your weaknesses and know where to focus your study.

* Follow the book’s guidelines on soft skills, resume prep, study timeline as well. Use it holistically as it was meant, it is an excellent resource.

* I know you prefer online resources but this book is the most well rounded comprehensive interview prep book (ie it covers a lot of ground relatively succinctly that you will need for interviews, including system design).
* Unfortunately I don’t believe this book is always sufficient prep by itself. So after you work through it your next step is to:
1. Get leetcode premium
2. Take the Grokking the System Design course

* Use Leetcode Premium specifically to do problems that are tagged to companies you are interested in and to do additional practice on areas you are weak at (ie if you suck at Dynamic Programming sort by all top rated DP problems and do them from easiest to hardest to build your intuition).

* Use Grokking the System Design Interview to cover ground not covered in Cracking the Coding Interview (CTCI). CTCI has a lot of great breadth but falls short of depth in some areas, this is one of them.

* Your last step / piece of overarching advice here is to create a timeline of when you would like to interview and work backwards. Once you are starting to seriously think about interviewing it is time to both practice problems for time and to do mock interviews (interviewing.io etc). Do your prep only with a pen / paper and a whiteboard (if that is the medium you expect to be interviewing in) and work on time.

* Once you hit the interviewing stage it is usually time to start scheduling some interviews you aren’t as psyched about for a test run. You need to get used to performing with interview jitters as well.

* So to recap:

* CTCI (maybe 3 months if no prior knowledge) -> Leetcode + Grokking (a month to start shoring things up) -> Keep Leetcoding / Practice + Doing mocks 1/2 times a week (a month) -> assess your progress if you’re ready to start interviewing -> Start doing interviews with lower priority companies -> Schedule interviews with FAANG


=> Google SWE (Blind: teamblind.com/article/Thank-you-Blind-JpZWEdHg)
* Did about 300 LC [20/50/30] (I ended up getting leetcode premium) (about 7 months)
* Some good tips for approaching leetcode: I eased into it with lc easy, put a lot of weight on medium and try to challenge myself with hard. If you can't solve a problem, don't look at the answer. Skip it and work on another one. I'll come back to the question and give it another try. Try to look for hints. If you still can't answer, look at the answer. Come back to the question again a month later and give it another try. Before you look at any answers, always remember to try it first.
* Read Cracking the Coding Interview and Computer Science Distilled. Also took Grokking the System Design Interview course. Watched a ton of cs-related youtube videos in my spare time.
* After getting LC out of the way, I wanted to get an idea of what the criteria was. I foudn a hiring manager on rooftop slushie. They took a look at my resume and gave me a referral. I also got some help regarding the behavioral portion, things like what they're looking for, what qualities I should present, and what kind of personal experiences to bring up.

=> Google SWE (https://www.rooftopslushie.com/request/Google-Onsite-Limit-1202)
=> What's required is practice - lots of it. Coding, system design, leadership.
* Plan for 1-2 months of sincere preparation (2-3 hours every day). About an hour in the morning and an hour in the evening, with larger blocks of time during weekends to take on larger chunks of tasks. I've provided some details on the interview prep for slightly more senior role (L5).
* Coding/problem solving: these are straightforward. You will be presented with a problem and you must think of an approach to solve it, implement code to demonstrate the solution, and reason about its runtime complexity (time and space). The interviewer might add some additional constraints to reason about efficiency or alternative approaches. Your goal is to arrive at the efficient solution and reason about the merits and pitfalls of various approaches along the way. Practicing the medium and hard questions on leetcode (www.leetcode.com) would be helpful here.
* The leadership question will be behavioral and you will be asked how to handle various types of situations like a disengaged teammate or conflicts of opinions etc.
* The system design interview will focus on how design a common use-case, for example a large e-commerce website or a music streaming service. The key is to focus on how to handle the complexities using well known strategies from distributed systems, stream-processing, map-reduce, services, pub-sub etc. You should have practiced enough problems so that common use-cases roll off your memory easily.
* Lastly, the ML interviews will be focused on a machine learning problem. The key here is to show that you grasp the various skills involved in being an ML engineer. This includes:
    * how to frame your objectives (what loss function will you optimize, why?),
    * select the right dataset (what data will you collect to train your model. Why? how to avoid bias and feedback loops. How will you collect labels or ground truth)
    * feature engineering - how will you transform the raw data into a form useful for models (e.g. normalization, missing values, data cleaning, etc)
    * model selection - what model to use for what type of problem and why (boosted decision trees, deep learning, logistic regression, factorization models etc)
    * training, validation and inference - how will the system be setup how will you do validation, how to address train/test skew etc.
    * productionization - how to monitor performance, how to handle problems, what if new model is corrupt or new training batch is incorrect etc.
* There might be a small coding session involved in the ML interview also, e.g. write code for autocomplete functionality on android keyboard.
* Finally, focus on leadership style interview questions. Learn about the company's leadership and culture. Practice talking about your top 3 projects that you accomplished that had measurable impact (you must know the metrics and numbers that measure success) and that you liked to work on. There will be one set of questions from your resume - your most interesting project and what you liked about it. Walk through a challenging project that you delivered, what was the challenge and how did you overcome it? Then there will be a few hypotheticals thrown in to see how you handle those situations (e.g. what if the eng lead of the partner team disagrees with the schedule for the project you're putting together for the team. How would you approach this situation)
* There will be questions around culture fit and your interest in working here. What's your favorite product from the company that you're interviewing? Why? Why do you want to work here? What excites you the most? Where do you see yourself in 5, 10 years? What are your career goals etc.
* Finally, another set of questions around people and communication skills. How will you handle difficult situations. How would you handle conflicts in a cross functional project spanning multiple teams with differing goals and priorities.

=> Google Interview Process (https://www.rooftopslushie.com/request/Google-SWE-Interview-Process-and-Timeline-24)
* The interview process starts with a recruiter reviewing a person's background to decide if it's worth interviewing them, and also what level they should be considered for. This is a process that I don't have any insight into as a SWE. (One thing to note, though, is that this is the only step where a candidate's resume really matters. Beyond this step, interviewers do theoretically have the ability to view a candidate's resume, but it's not supposed to influence the ratings we give, so a lot of interviewers don't even bother reading it).
* The next step is a phone interview. When the phone interview is scheduled, the recruiter will send the candidate a link to a shared Google doc which will be used for the interview. When the interview happens, a SWE will call the candidate on the phone, and ask them one or more algorithms questions, which the candidate should code a solution to in the Google doc. (Typically it's just one question).
* The phone interview is scheduled to be 45 minutes long, and interviewers are supposed to leave around 10 minutes for the candidate to ask questions at the end, so there's usually roughly 35 minutes to solve the coding question(s). Interviewers typically like to ask questions where the optimal solution is feasible to reach within the allotted time, although there is no hard rule about this.
* After the phone interview, the interviewer will submit an interview rating which consists of:
An overall rating for the candidate, which is one of: strong no hire, no hire, lean no hire, lean hire, hire, strong hire.
A short explanation for the overall rating
A 4-point rating & short explanation for each of a few categories like "coding skills", "comprehension and communication", etc. (These changed pretty recently for SWEs, and are slightly different for intern interviews, so I don't remember the exact categories).
Optionally, a 4-point rating & short explanation for more personality-related categories that measure aspects of leadership or "googleyness", which historically most interviewers leave blank. There's recently been a push to be more deliberate about evaluating these, but I'm not aware of the details yet.
A longer document with notes on how the whole interview went
The timeline for an interviewer to submit this feedback is less than 2 business days in most cases.
* After a recruiter receives the feedback from the phone interview, they will decide whether or not to bring the candidate for onsite interviews. (Or, rarely, they will schedule a second phone interview. From what I understand, this mostly happens because the first interviewer screwed up somehow, and isn't really anything to worry about). I don't have insight into how long recruiters usually take at this step.
* When a candidate comes for an onsite interview, a candidate will usually be scheduled for 4 interviews plus a "lunch interview". Usually two interviews, then lunch, then the last two. The only major differences between onsite and phone interviews are that onsites happen on a whiteboard, and interviewers more often use the full 45 minutes to ask the interview questions, since candidates have time to ask their lunch interviewer questions. Onsites are also somewhat more likely to have 2 (easier) questions, instead of just 1, since there is more time. The lunch interviewer does not rate the candidate, and is just there to make small talk and answer questions (though I think this might be different for different roles or something? In any case, it wouldn't be kept a secret if the candidate was being evaluated during lunch).
* The onsite interviewers submit the same style of feedback as phone interviewers. After they have all submitted feedback, the recruiter will decide whether or not to refer the candidate to a hiring committee. A candidate with very little or no positive feedback usually is outright rejected, but people with mixed feedback or better usually go to the hiring committee. I've never been on a hiring committee, so I don't know a lot about what happens at this point, but the high-level summary is that the committee will review all of the phone and onsite interviewers' feedback and use that to issue a hire/no hire decision. Hiring committees might also recommend a hire, but at a lower level than the candidate was evaluated for. Candidates often don't hear back about the hiring committee decision for at least 2 weeks.
* If the committee recommends a hire, then at that point the recruiter will schedule "fit calls" with managers from a few teams, to see if there's mutual interest between the candidate and that manager. (Sometimes this step may happen before the onsite interviews, instead. I don't know what determines this). Fit calls are pretty unstructured, and not really fail-able, in the sense that even if none of the teams you talk to are interested, the recruiter will likely just schedule you with more teams (this may be less true if the fit calls happen before onsite interviews). That said, getting an offer is dependent on matching with a team, so candidates should try to ask good questions and be personable. After matching with a team, a candidate will get an offer. I don't know how the offer amount is determined.
